6,1,We are given a nodejs API which we can read/write the notes,A/I,
6,2,"Follow the instruction on the landing page and visit /help, and we can see a hidden file fetcher API:",A,
6,3,"Okay, let's try to guess the filename of the server",A,
6,4,"Visiting /fetchJSAPI/fetch/server.js, it turns out the server is named server.js",A/I,"3,4"
6,5,Note that the param must end in .js,I,
6,6,Otherwise the server will not return the file content.,I,
6,7,The main script includes other routers in ./api/routes/routes,I,
6,8,"However, most of the note API is not interesting because the read-only in config.json is set to true",I,
6,9,We cannot create/delete a new note,A,8
6,10,Here is the note router source code:,,
6,11,"In other APIs, the most suspicious one is status:",I,
6,12,"It will execute those innocuous shell commands when visiting this API, but how to manipulate the hard-coded commands? The first thought comes to my mind is javascript prototype polution",A/I,12
6,13,If we can modify the prototype we can inject arbitrary command!,A,12
6,14,The only thing we can control is through the note API,I,
6,15,It use lodash to merge the note with empty one,I,
6,16,Then I search the lodash vulnerability and find this interesting,A,15
6,17,It's just what we needed - Prototype Pollution.,I,
6,18,So the rest is trivial,I,
6,19,Pollute the command object and get RCE of the server,A,
6,20,"Although I can use percent-encoding %2f to send /, I can't bypass the file extension check.",A/I,20
6,21,Actually I don't have other failled attempts,,
6,22,"If you cannot come out of Prototype pollution, don't be disappointed",,
6,23,At least you learn something new :),,
6,24,"Unsolved, for the compelte writeup please refer to @YShahinzadeh's writeup",,
6,25,"Basically this is a SSRF challenge, using @ to make the google.com part being interperted as HTTP Basic access authentication.",I,
6,26,I get the db.json through visiting http://162.243.23.15:8000/db.json/,A,
6,27,Just append a slash.,A,
6,28,"It's silly I didn't solve this one, because I forget to try the empty string in the path parameter.....",A/I,28
6,29,so I assume it must be /.,A,
6,30,Failed Attempts,A,
6,31,"But the http module works well with ../, so I think it's not the vulnerable version.",A/I,"30,31"
6,32,The echo API even doesn't return anything if we access it directly.,A/I,"30,32"
6,33,Add the header X-SSLVPN-Request-Id: 9B60:6E97:25ADB08:45E4D17:5AE34BA4 in the requests,A,30
6,34,It's totally useless.,I,"30,33"
