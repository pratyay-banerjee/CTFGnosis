8,1,First the server gives the link to proxy/internal_website/public_notes and proxy/internal_website/public_links in the landing page,I,
8,2,"I try to use different API endpoint like proxy/internal_website/aaaa, and the server returns all the availble API for me:","A,I",1
8,3,Let's check out source_code of the server:,A,
8,4,The server basically behaves like a reverse proxy,I,3
8,5,"Excluding /proxy/interal_website, all the other APIs require the connection from localhost",I,3
8,6,The main objective is visiting /flag/:token via /proxy/internal_website/:page but we have to find an approach to bypass the following constraints:,I,3
8,7,:page doesn't contain flag,I,3
8,8,":page starts with public_notes, public_links or source_code",I,3
8,9,cannot contain / (because express params is split by /),I,3
8,10,"Okay, so let's take a look at how many parser are parsing our request:",A,3
8,11,"Actually 1 is not necessary, but just a friendly reminder: your browser might parse your url first, e.g.: /asd/../ggg becomes /ggg.",I,10
8,12,The most possible parsers to exploit are 2 and 3,I,10
8,13,Note that the server even gives the version information,I,10
8,14,"After a few fuzzing, I found in 2 you can pass some non-pritable chracter through percent-encoding","A,I",10
8,15,In 3 you can use backslash to represent /.,I,10
8,16,However it's still not enough to bypass the constraint 2.,I,10
8,17,Then I start to google some interesting information of path parsing,A,10
8,18,"I remember in blackhat 2017, there is an great SSRF slide by Orange Tsai from Taiwan",I,17
8,19,Please refer to page 44.,I,17
8,20,Actually we can do some CSRF injection here using \uff0d\uff0a,"A,I",17
8,21,Another interesting ariticle of CSRF injection I found is request splitting by Ryan Kelly,I,20
8,22,We can inject two CRLFs to make the nodejs socket send another request!,I,20
8,23,The rest is trivial,,
8,24,Just send the request to /flag/:token,A,20
8,25,Here is the final payload:,,
8,26,"You can also use double-encoding %2561 to represent a, or backslash to represent / in order to bypass the constrinat.",I,24
8,27,Failed attempts,,
8,28,Using ../ to bypass the constaint 2 in node http module,A,
8,29,Actually node v11.0.0 supports this feature,I,28
8,30,"We can pass the /aaaaa/../flag to the parameter, the node http will resolve to /flag and send the request to /flag",A,
8,31,However this doesn't work in node v8.12.0.,I,30
8,32,Using ../ or percent encoding to bypass the constaint2 in express router,A,
8,33,However express seems to parse the API very strictly.....,I,32
8,34,I can't even make the express parsing incorrectly,A,
8,35,Write a fuzzing script to find characters which make the parser parsing incorrectly:,A,
8,36,"Nothing interesting in node v8.12, but this script help me to find this interesting payload in node v11.0.0",A,
