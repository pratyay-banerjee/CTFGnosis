Express yourself - 35C3 CTF

Category: zajebiste (web) Points: 500

This year I attended 35C3 conference so I didn't have time to actually participate in the CTF with my team 5BC. After the CTF was over, my colleague challenged me to solve the express-yourself challenge which apparently no one solved during the event. I like source code auditing so I accepted the challenge.

(Beware - A lot of php code coming up...)

Introduction

The challenge description:

I heard nowadays the cool kids like Donald J. Trump use ExpressionEngine to express themselves on the Internet. After all, the "Best CMS" is just about good enough for the bestest presidents.

This morning I set up a default install and gave it a try, do you like it?

PSA: dont dirbuster it... you won't find anything

Info: Here are a few deployment details: https://35c3ctf.ccc.ac/uploads/express_yourself_deployment_details.txt in case you got confused why the system directory might be missing.

Hint: flag is in db

Hint2: challenge was probably a bit miscategorized in the "web" category, it belongs into the zajebiste category. There are no hidden files or anything, see the deployment script. you can set up the same environment locally and pwn it. no need to bruteforce anything, good luck

So basically the task was to install ExpressEngine using the deployment script (Which "hardens" the setup), audit the source code, find vulnerabilities in the default setup to get the flag.

Before digging into the source code, I like to blackbox test the system. I usually open Burpsuite and navigate through the pages/features of the system. That way, I get the feeling of how large the initial attack surface is. In that stage/audit stage I take small notes of vulnerabilty classes/vectors that are likely to be found in the system. That way I can focus the research on this list.

Here are some of the notes I took during the research:

1. When sending feedback at the contact page, it sends "allow_attachments" parameter, maybe there is a way to upload attachments?
2. Expression Engine... maybe EL injection?
3. They are using controllers, Maybe LFI in controller inclusion? Also, search for autoload, and functions that can cause autoload, like class_exists and new $xxx. Also, there is a method called load_class which can load classes.
4. File read/xxe? PHAR -> unserialize?
5. SSRF?
6. SQL Injection? I will need to select the flag from the db, so either SQLi, file read to read the config and code execution?
7. __call functions can be interesting
8. _get_meta_vars leads to object injection if I could somehow leak the key...

Understanding the system

Starting with understanding how the controllers work might give us insights into how the system is constructed. How can we use controllers? How can we invoke methods? and so on... Eventually, after some research, it appears that there are some potentially interesting controller methods, but how do we invoke them? Simple! REST API!

http://URL/index.php/[directory]/[controller]/[method]/[params]

Params can also be passed through $_GET/$_POST. 

But apparently, the root index.php contain the following lines:

By default, the controller parsing is ignored and only the index method from the legacy controller ee can be called! What it contains? Let's dive in.

Here is a short version of the index function. We can see that if REQ is equal to "ACTION", which means that the ACT parameter was supplied by $_GET/$_POST, then it calls generate_action function. Otherwise, it calls generate_page. The more interesting method is generate_action:

We can see that this function instantiate the EE_Actions class. Let's see the constructor:

If the ACT parameter was supplied, the function selects the class and method from the actions table by the supplied id. Later we can see the instantiation of the selected class and execution of the method. So what is our attack surface?

We can focus the research on this list and start looking at each function.

The solution

An interesting entry in the list is the filemanager_endpoint. What does it do? Why we can access this method unauthenticated? This function actually calls process_request from the Filemanager class, so let's look at this function:

This function does a lot! By supplying an action we can get into many flows, but let's focus now on the directory_contents flow. At the start of the directory_contents function it calls to the datatables function:

We can see that this function takes a lot of parameters from the user. One interesting parameter is tbl_sort. It looks like if it wasn't supplied, $state gets set to a default sorting. Otherwise, it sets as a user controlled sorting. Later, the above parameters get passed to the ee()->table->datasource function:

The $options parameter overrides some of the settings. Below we can see a check for the tbl_sort parameter again. If it was supplied, it overrides the sort settings in the settings variable. This raises a big red flag:

A user controlled data can be set as the key of a sort. This can be a bad practice, because sort usually means SQL order by, and if we understand correctly we can probably influence the column name by which the order by occurs. Column names are sometimes not sanitized properly because they don't come from user input. So, next, the $controller->$func is being executed. $func is the _file_datasource function:

So our assumptions were correct. Indeed the sort parameter is used as order by. The _browser_get_files calls to the ee()->file_model->get_files function with the $file_params so let's see what it does:

Looks like the get_files function "constructs" an SQL query. We were interested in the "order by" flow. It loops through the $parameters['order'] and if the $key is not equals "upload_location_name" it just calls $this->db->order_by function with the $key variable appended to the key, and the value. I will spare you the long function, but as we assumed it doesn't sanitize the key properly and we have an SQL injection vulnerability!

Here is a picture of the malicious request being sent to a local server (runs in debug mode): 

You can clearly see the 'out of context' string. From here it's a trivial exploitation:

1. Get the list of databases and see that there is a database called "flag".
2. Get the tables from the flag database and see that there is a table called "flag".
3. "select flag from flag" and get the desired flag: 35c3_pl3ase_d0nt_pwn_tRump_wItH_th1s :)

The unintended solution
So... If you remember in the switch/case in the process_request function, there was an upload flow. Interesting...

The upload_file actually calls _upload_file ("upload_dir" is a directory id which we can easily get by calling to the directory function from the switch/case).

So what this function does?

1.    Cleans the name of the supplied file
2.    Checks if the allowed_type equals "image"? In our case it is
3.    Checks for XSS in the file content!?
4.    Calls do_upload to upload the file..

Sorry for the long function... Let's explain what's going on:

1.    First it sets some properties with values from the uploaded image

2. Checks for hidden files and disallowed file names like .htaccess

3.    Checks for allowed file types. Firstly because our file has to be an image, it checks that our file is an actual image, but this can be bypassed by just uploading a valid image and appending extra content at the end. Next it checks the file extensions.. and this is where they use black list: 'php', 'php3', 'php4', 'php5', 'php7', 'phps', 'phtml'.

4.    If you know the Apache web server and it's php configuration well, you probably can guess that they forgot to filter .pht, which also runs as PHP!

5.    So the last step we have to bypass is the do_embedded_php_check check. They check if the file contains the <?php string. If it does, then they bail out. Otherwise, everything is ok. This can be easily bypassed by using a shortened version of a PHP code. For example <?=echo '123';?>

After all of those checks, the file is uploaded to the directory we chose by the directory_id parameter..

So all we need to do is:

1.    Create an image with an appended PHP code
2.    Upload it using the API with a name ending with '.pht'
3.    Profit!?

So I had luck, and the CTF server was actually running Apache. I tried the exploit on it and it didn't work. The file just didn't execute as PHP... Something was wrong. The server was running the latest Ubuntu and I didn't, so I immediately installed a fresh copy and also installed the latest Apache server, PHP available. After checking the configuration I noticed that the regex responsible for catching PHP files changed, and .pht is not a valid extension anymore. However .phar was added to the list :O

So I quickly changed my exploit and you can see yourself.
