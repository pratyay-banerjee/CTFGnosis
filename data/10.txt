We should get shell in order to retrieve the flag in Oh My raddit 2.
Arbitrary File Read

Since we have the DES key now, we can first decrypt the ciphertext of the download command:

m=d&f=uploads%2F70c97cc1-079f-4d01-8798-f36925ec1fd7.pdf

Let's try specifying the path now. Does it work? Yes, it works!

m=d&f=app.py

Read the following files:

Here is the source code of app.py:


Browsing source code / issues

First I found this issue, and it's reported by Orange Tsai, who is the author of the challenge. Gotcha!

This issue is fixed in webpy 0.39, but the server side still use 0.38! Thus it's vulnerable to SQLite injection through limit parameter.

@kaibro found another issue. They try to fix eval code execution by passing a empty builtin to it.


When eval takes the second parameter with builtin in it, the current builtin will be replaced. In the source code the builtins is set to an empty object. In other words, passing builtin is similarly to replace the current namespace.

However, replacing the namespace doesn't prevent us to retrieve other exploitable classes. We just cannot directly use eval, __import__ ....

First, list all the classes through 

Take a closer look. There is <class 'subprocess.Popen'> class, so it's trivial to RCE now!

My payload:

It's worth to mention @qazwsxedcrfvtg14 's more creative payload. I can't believe that an unbounded method can access __globals__ in Python 2.7 !

The flag is hitcon{Fr0m_SQL_Injecti0n_t0_Shell_1s_C00L!!!}.
